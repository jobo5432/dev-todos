# dev-todos
This is a simple Windows(tm) tray application which will allow developers to manage their intra-day activities, including nagging reminders aimed to keep you on task for the day.

*Why?* Because developers are multi-tasking all the time, and making the time to nag a another developer, manager, or product manager/owner to resolve a blocked issue, reach out to a client, or even take a lunch. Also, we've all gone down the tutorial path in the context of a todo app. I was tired of writing throw-away code, so I'm going to make these tuts into a useful application.

## Roadmap
_All versions are tentative and subject to vast, sweeping, changes, because well, I can..._

**version 1.0** - An MVP release. Just a tray app with +/- todos. No persistence.

**Version 1.1** - Add persistence (SQLite or similar)

**Version 1.2** - Add desktop notifications/reminders of upcoming tasks
